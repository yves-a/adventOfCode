# Advent of Code (Catching Up)

My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

I’m catching up this year since I had exams at the beginning of December, so days may be completed out of order.

## Structure
- `day1/`, `day2/`, ...: each day’s solution(s)
- Input files are kept local (not committed)

## Running
Each folder typically contains instructions or a script to run that day’s solution.

## Notes
Focused on clean, readable solutions first, then optimizations where it’s fun/needed.
